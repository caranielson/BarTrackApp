# BarTrackApp
This is an app created by Isabel Stoddart, Cara Nielson, and Krishti Bhowmick for an iOS undergrad class at UT Austin.

The app allows users to rate bars on Crowdedness, Wait Time, Scrictness, and Popularity. The users pick which bar they want to see and the ratings for that bar come up. The user can then add their own rating. The ratings are updated in real time using Firebase.

This is a beta version of this app and this app was never added to the app store.

This app was created using Xcode.
